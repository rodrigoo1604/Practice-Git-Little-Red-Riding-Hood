          Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every
          one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there
          was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave
          her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she
          would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red
          Riding Hood.
